How to make short instructional videos for YouTube; without narrating them yourself!

[[slnc 2000]]

The methods used in this video prioritize accessibility, as one single transcript is used to create both the audio and the subtitles. Users can slow the video down, or pause it, so that it is easier to learn and practice skills.

Disclaimer: This tutorial primarily features Mac computers. For reasons unbeknownst to me, the workflow for recording voice to text on PC computers is complex. Too complex to communicate in a video such as this. I plan to release a PC version of this tutorial once I can simplify the process.

You’ll need: an idea, screen record tool, text editor, and a simple video editor, like Adobe Rush, or Camtasia.

[[slnc 1000]]

Step 1: come up with an idea.

[[slnc 1000]]

Video tutorials teach discrete, observable skills. Focus on one skill at a time; remember, you can always make a series!

Step 2: stay organized.

[[slnc 1000]]

Create a folder for each type of asset: audio, text, and video. Name each asset with the same convention. For example, in the text folder, save the transcript file as, transcript, underscore, project, dash, name, dot, text.

[[slnc 1000]]

Step 3: record your screen.

[[slnc 1000]]

Make a screen recording of the skill you wish to demonstrate. It helps to practice a few times before you begin. Try to keep the recording less than 3 to 4 minutes long. 

[[slnc 1000]]

Save your screen recording in the video folder.

[[slnc 1000]]

Before you begin, turn your notifications off, for privacy. 

[[slnc 1000]]

Press, command shift 5, to open the screen recording options. Adjust the screen capture window.

[[slnc 1000]]

From the options menu: set save location, set timer, set microphone as none, set show mouse clicks.

[[slnc 1000]]

Step 4: write it down.

[[slnc 1000]]

Open the Text Edit program. As you watch the video you just recorded, type out a transcript that describe the actions in your screen recording. Use clear, concise language, say the name of any button or link you press, and don’t add extra information. If it’s not on the screen, don’t talk about it! 

[[slnc 1000]]

Save your transcript in the ‘text’ folder.

[[slnc 1000]]

Use commas or semicolons as natural pauses in the text. As an example, listen to the difference between the following sentences. 

[[slnc 750]]

Statistics Canada Data finding and adjusting tables. Or.

[[slnc 1000]]

Statistics Canada Data, finding and adjusting tables.

[[slnc 750]]

Use, s l n c 1000, wrapped in double square brackets, between phrases for longer pauses. 

[[slnc 750]]

1000 = 1 second.

[[slnc 1000]]

Step 5: convert text to audio.

[[slnc 1000]]

Open the System Preferences application. 

[[slnc 1000]]

Then press, Keyboard, Shortcuts. Then, in the, Services, menu, enable, Add Music as a Spoken Track.

[[slnc 1000]]

Go back to Text Edit and highlight your entire transcript by pressing, Command, A. Then, in the top left menu bar click on, Text Edit, Services, Add Music as a Spoken Track. Select the narration voice, and set the filename. 

[[slnc 1000]]

Changing the file location doesn't always work, so let the file open in Apple Music. 

[[slnc 1000]]

You will need to adjust your transcript to get the phrasing and the pauses right. Edit the transcript as you listen to the recording. Cut out unnecessary words. 

[[slnc 1000]]

Remember, use clear, concise language. 

[[slnc 1000]]

When you've finished making edits, copy the file, and then paste it into the, Audio, folder.

[[slnc 1000]]

Step 6: put it all together.

[[slnc 1000]]

Create a new project in Adobe Rush, or whatever video editing software you use, and import your audio and video assets. If you have more than one video file, import them in order.

[[slnc 1000]]

Adobe Rush has a lot of features. You can create, custom title screens, and overlays.

[[slnc 1000]]

You can also add transitions between sections of the video.

[[slnc 1000]]

It’s likely that the audio is longer than the video, or vice versa. Fix the timing by adjusting the speed of the video. Splice the video to adjust the speed in specific sections. Do not adjust the audio speed.

[[slnc 1000]]

If things still aren't right, you may need to edit your transcript and re record the audio. This takes less time than redoing the video.

[[slnc 1000]]

Step 7: create the subtitles

[[slnc 1000]]

Save a copy of, transcript, underscore, project, dash, name, dot, text, as, subtitles, underscore, project, dash, name, dot, text. Remove the extra commas and timing codes, but keep the newlines between phrases.

[[slnc 1000]]

Upload the video to YouTube, then copy/paste the subtitle text into the subtitles editor.

[[slnc 1000]]

The great thing about these videos is that they are easy to edit. If something changes, you just need to update the transcript and subtitle files, re record the audio, splice the change into the video, and push it back to YouTube. 

[[slnc 1000]]

Keeping an organized file structure ensures that you have access to all of the original assets, and it makes it much easier to change the video when you need to.
